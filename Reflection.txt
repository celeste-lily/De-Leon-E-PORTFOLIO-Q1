<p> Reflecting back on this quarter, there's certainly a lot to say. It was the first quarter of grade nine, along with that, a new set of challenges and skills to learn. We started with XHTML, a stricter version of the programming language we grew to utilize frequently, HTML, which was followed by the addition of links and creation of lists, tables, and forms using HTML. We performed hands-on a plenty, accompanied by multiple written works, seatworks, performance tasks, quizzes and tests. Some lessons and activities, were easy or moderate in difficulty, while others were more difficult. We had hardships and triumphs, peace and chaos, adb everything else in between. Overall, this quarter was an interesting one, one that intices students to learn more and challenges their skills about their prior knowledge, and I'm glad to say that I myself am looking forward to future quarters and the lessons of knowledge about ICT they hold. </p>
